"""
This program is started at boot by the kdna daemon. It generates a log every x seconds to demonstrate the python service.

The program takes one integer command-line argument as input, interpreted as the time in seconds between logs.

Contents:
    - :func:`main`: generates logs every x seconds (delay given as command-line argument).

    Main function.

    Inputs:
        No parameters.
        This function takes one command-line argument x, an integer interpreted as the time in seconds between logs.
    Ouputs:
        0 -> no errors or exceptions.
        1 -> Generic error 'Exception'.
        2 -> 'ValueError' (e.g. during type conversion).
        3 -> 'IndexError' (e.g. during sys.argv list traversal).

    """
    Main function. Generates logs every on a given delay in seconds (delay given as command-line argument).

    The command-line argument is retrieved in a try/catch block. If no exceptions are raised, an infinite loop starts and the function creates logs periodically.

    :return: returns an error code among (0, 1, 2, 3)
    :rtype: int

    :raises ValueError: May occur during conversion of the command-line argument from string to integer.
    :raises IndexError: May occur during argument list traversal (empty sys.argv list, no command-line arguments).

    :note:
    The imported packages are subprocess, time and sys.
    subprocess is used to run bash commands in a shell from the program.
    time is used to wait for the chosen delay between logs.
    sys is used to retrieve command-line arguments
